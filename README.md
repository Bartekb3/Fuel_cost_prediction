# Fuel cost prediction

## Key Objectives

1. **Maximize Efficiency of Jet Usage**:
   - Calculate the maximum number of jets that The League will need throughout the 2102 season.
   - Generate a time-series graph to visualize how many teams will be in-flight simultaneously during the 2102 season.
   - Store the maximum number of teams in flight at the same time in a variable named `max_teams_in_flight`.

2. **Project Fuel Costs for 2102**:
   - Using jet fuel prices from the 2101 season, project the prices for 2102.
   - Apply these fuel price projections to every flight scheduled for each team to estimate the total fuel spend for the entire season.
   - Store the total projected fuel spend for 2102 in a variable named `total_fuel_spend_2102_dollars`.
